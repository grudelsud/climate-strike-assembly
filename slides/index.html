						<h3>Why are we all here today?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Let's start with a quick history of our planet.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- BEFORE HUMANS + GHG -->
				<section>
					<section id="time-machine">
						<p>We need to go back to 70 million years ago, long before humans inhabited this planet</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="../img/cretaceous.jpg" id="cretaceous">
						<p class=""><span>Back then, in an period called Cretaceous...</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>dinosaurs still roamed the world</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>climate was much warmer and humid</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>oceans were higher and ice caps didn't exist</span> </p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="../img/atmosphere.jpg" id="greenhouse">
						<p><span>One of the reasons for warm climate during that time was the high level of greenhouse gases (GHG)</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>The primary GHGs in Earth's atmosphere are <strong>water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane</strong></span> </p>
					</section>
					<section id="greenhouse-explained">
						<p><small>Greenhouse gases absorb energy from both the sun and the Earth's surface, and emit it back into the atmosphere</small> </p>
						<img width="800" src="../img/greenhouse-effect.png" alt="Greenhouse effect">
					</section>
					<section id="carbon-cycle" data-background="../img/forest.jpg">
						<p><span>For millions of years, trees have sucked carbon dioxide from the atmosphere</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>storing carbon in wood while growing, and releasing oxygen in the air</span>	</p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>then dying and going underground to transform, becoming <strong>coal</strong> and <strong>oil</strong></span> </p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- PROGRESS -->
				<section>
					<section id="fast-forward">
						<p>Fast forward 70 million years, from the last Triceratops and T-Rex</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>to 1750!</strong> </p>
						<p class="fragment">Our planet had substantially cooled off from the Cretaceous period</p>
						<p class="fragment">And something beautiful was about to happen...</p>
					</section>
					<section id="industrial-revolution"  data-background="../img/steam-engine.jpg">
						<h4><span>The industrial revolution</span> </h4>
						<p class="fragment"><span>Europe and the United States went from hand production methods to machines</span>	</p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>We started using machines powered by steam</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>We invented new processes to produce iron</span> </p>
					</section>
					<section id="today" data-background="../img/tokyo.jpg">
						<h4><span>During the following 250 years, until now</span> </h4>
						<p class="fragment"><span>We've become richer, healthier and longer living</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>The population has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#History">increased</a> from ~1Bn to ~8Bn and moved to the cities</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>We need bigger buildings, more food, more cars, more Playstations! ü§© üè¢ üå≠ üöó üéÆ</span> </p>
					</section>
					<section id="fossil-fuels">
						<p>All of this comes at a price...</p>
						<p class="fragment">We need more energy, <strong>a lot</strong> of it</p>
						<p class="fragment">So we use what we have readily available: <br> <strong>coal, gas and oil</strong>, AKA fossil fuels</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- PROBLEM -->
				<section>
					<section id="emissions" data-background="../img/refinery.jpg">
						<h4><span>So, here's the problem</span> </h4>
						<p class="fragment"><span>We are taking carbon from undergound, where it has been stored for millions of years</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>We burn it with oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>All these GHGs warm the planet, bringing back the clock to the dinosaurs period</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>Ice caps will melt, oceans will rise, deserts will expand, and there are now ~8Bn of us on Earth</span> </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>How do we stop it?</h4>
						<p>we need to stop burning fossil fuels, and start capturing greenhouse gases from air</p>
						<p class="fragment">and we need to do it pretty fast! we have about 15 years to change and avoid the worst consequences of climate change</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- SOLUTIONS -->
				<section>
					<section id="breakdown">
						<h4>So, where do we start?</h4>
						<p> <strong>Everywhere!</strong> reasons for climate change are evenly spread across all sectors</p>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Electricity: 25% - powers your üì∫</li>
							<li>Agriculture: 24% - every ingredient in your üçî</li>
							<li>Manufaturing: 21% - all your üïπÔ∏èand ‚öΩ</li>
							<li>Transportation: 14% - your family üöò</li>
							<li>Buidings: 6% - your üè†</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Now the good news: <br>no one is too small to make a difference!</p>
					</section>
					<section id="transports" data-background="../img/bus.jpg">
						<h4><span>Transportation</span></h4>
						<p><span>Use public transport, walk to school, reduce use of private vehicles to a minimum</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>we are producing more electric cars, but we will need 10x more energy, where is it going to come from?</span></p>
					</section>
					<section id="buildings" data-background="../img/house.jpg">
						<h4><span>Buildings and heat</span></h4>
						<p><span>have a shower instead of a bath, use warmer clothes during winter, improve insulation at home, get rid of natural gas for heating systems if you can</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>"electrification of heat" is happening, but we will need 10x more energy, where is it going to come from?</span></p>
					</section>
					<section id="electricity" data-background="../img/offshore-wind.jpg">
						<h4><span>Electricity is key</span></h4>
						<p><span>We need to use alternatives to fossil fuels: <br> wind, sun, rivers, oceans and nuclear</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>and we need to find better ways to store this energy</span></p>
					</section>
					<section id="manufacturing" data-background="../img/shopping.jpg">
						<h4><span>Manufaturing (making things)</span></h4>
						<p><span>Reduce single use plastics wherever you can</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span> Think before you buy! </span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>Kinder eggs, bottles of water, pasta, toothpaste, shampoo, toys, vegetables.</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>All is wrapped in plastic</span></p>
					</section>
					<section id="agriculture" data-background="../img/field.jpg">
						<h4><span>Agriculture (farming)</span></h4>

						<p class="fragment"><span>You can join the strike <strong>today at 11am</strong> from school</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>to tell everybody that change is coming, whether we like it or not!</span></p>
