				<!-- BEFORE HUMANS + GHG -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<p>We need to go back to 70 million years ago, long before humans inhabited this planet</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="../img/cretaceous.jpg" id="cretaceous">
						<p class=""><span>Back then, in an period called Cretaceous...</span></p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>dinosaurs still roamed the world</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>climate was much warmer and humid</span> </p>
						<p class="fragment"><span>oceans were higher and ice caps didn't exist</span> </p>
					</section>
					<section id="greenhouse">
						<p>One of the reasons for warm climate during the Cretaceous period was the high level of greenhouse gases (GHG)</p>
						<p class="fragment">A GHG absorbs energy from the sun and emits it back into the atmosphere</p>

				<!-- PROGRESS -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<p>Fast forward 70 million years, from the last Triceratops and T-Rex</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>to 1750!</strong> </p>
						<p class="fragment">Our planet had substantially cooled off from the Cretaceous period</p>
						<p class="fragment">And something beautiful was about to happen...</p>
					</section>
					<section id="industrial-revolution">
						<h4>The industrial revolution</h4>
						<p class="fragment">Europe and the United States went from hand production methods to machines</p>
						<p class="fragment">We started using machines powered by steam</p>
						<p class="fragment">We invented new processes to produce iron</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>During the following 250 years, until now</h4>
						<p class="fragment">We've become richer, healthier and longer living</p>
						<p class="fragment">The population has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population#History">increased</a> from ~1Bn to ~8Bn and moved to the cities</p>
						<p class="fragment">We need bigger buildings, more food, more cars, more Playstations! ü§© üè¢ üå≠ üöó üéÆ</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>All of this comes at a price...</p>
						<p class="fragment">We need more energy, <strong>a lot</strong> of it</p>
						<p class="fragment">So we use what we have readily available: <br> <strong>coal, gas and oil</strong>, AKA fossil fuels</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- PROBLEM -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h4>So, here's the problem</h4>
						<p class="fragment">We are taking carbon from undergound, where it has been stored for millions of years</p>
						<p class="fragment">We burn carbon with oxygen, releasing carbon dioxide to the atmosphere</p>
						<p class="fragment">All these GHGs are warming the planet again, bringing back the clock to the dinosaurs period</p>
						<p class="fragment">This is a big problem: ocean will rise, ice caps will melt, deserts will expand, but there are now ~8B human beings on Earth</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>How do we stop it?</h4>
						<p>we need to stop burning fossil fuels, and start capturing greenhouse gases from air</p>
						<p class="fragment">and we need to do it pretty fast: we have about 15 years to change trends and stay within reasonable climate change parameters</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- SOLUTIONS -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h4>OK, so... where do we start?</h4>
						<p>Answer: <strong>everywhere!</strong> reasons for climate change are evenly spread across all sectors:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Electricity: 25%</li>
							<li>Agriculture: 24%</li>
							<li>Manufaturing: 21%</li>
							<li>Transportation: 14%</li>
							<li>Buidings: 6%</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The good news is that there are actions we can all take to reduce our impact</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Transportation</h4>
						<p>Use public transport, walk, reduce use of private vehicles to a minimum</p>
						<p class="fragment">we are producing more electric cars, but we will need 10x more energy, where is it going to come from?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Buildings and heat</h4>
						<p>improve insulation, use better materials, get rid of natural gas for heating systems</p>
						<p class="fragment">"electrification of heat" is happening, but we will need 10x more energy</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Electricity is key</h4>
						<p>We need to use alternatives to fossil fuels: wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, tidal</p>
						<p class="fragment">and we need to find new efficient ways to store this energy</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Manufaturing</h4>
						<p>Reduce use of single use plastics to a minimum</p>
						<p class="fragment">start thinking of any object you buy: pasta, toothpaste, shampoo, toys</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Agriculture</h4>
						<p>Try to eat mainly plants, eat less meat, try to avoid beef and dairy</p>

						<p>I'm sorry, we messed this up. I did.<br> Your parents and grandparents did.</p>
						<p class="fragment">And now we need your help to fix this mess.</p>
						<p class="fragment">So back to my initial question:</p>
						<h3 class="fragment">Why are we all here today?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We are here because we want our voices heard</p>
						<p class="fragment">We want all governments on earth to do something for climate change <strong>NOW</strong> </p>
						<p class="fragment">And we need your voices to be heard among everybody else's</p>

						<p>You know, I am a big fan of Marvel movies</p>
