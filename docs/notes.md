# Presentation structure

**Intro**

- why are we all here today? let's start with a quick history of our world

**Part 1.** before humans

- 250-65 million years ago: dinosaurs, forests, and humid hot weather
- hot because of greenhouse gas effect
- millions of years of trees sucking carbon dioxide, dying and going underground
- trees get carbon dioxide from air, grow by fixing carbon in wood, release oxygen
- rotting trees underground become coal and oil

**Part 2.** progress

- 18th century and onwards, the industrial revolution: coal, steel, cars, plastic
- population rising, people getting richer and moving to cities: big buildings, intensive farming
- we need a lot of energy, coal and oil are easy, AKA fossil fuels

**Part 3.** we have a problem

- here's the problem: burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide
- so we're going back to dinosaur age, without dinosaurs and a lot more people!
- this is a big problem because temperatures will rise, melting ice caps, raising oceans, etc.
- how do we stop this? stop burning fossil fuels and capture carbon dioxide from air

**Part 4.** yes ok, but how do we fix it

- where do we start? everywhere! the 75% problem
- transport: build electric cars. we need 10x more energy, but where is it coming from?
- buildings & heat: use better materials and heat sources. we need 10x more energy.
- electricity is key: we need to use alternatives. Wind, solar, nuclear, hydro, tidal.
- manufacturing: reduce use of plastic, but what are the alternatives?
- agriculture: mainly eat plants, eat less meat, try to avoid beef and dairy. And plant trees!
- education: study, and grow up healthy and informed https://www.drawdown.org/solutions

**Part 5.** the future

- I'm sorry, we messed this up. Our fathers and mothers messed it up. We need you guys to help us fix it.
- you will be the next Elon Musk or Bill Gates. Want some ideas? start from here http://www.b-t.energy/landscape/
- we're here today because we want all governments on earth to help us doing it
- let's build a bright future together. Let's build Wakanda.
